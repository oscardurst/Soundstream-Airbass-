# Soundstream-Airbass-
Car audio old school is becoming popular nowadays, that is why I've decided to recreate an accessory which was popular back in the day, but now is hard to find. I am talking about the Soundstream Airbass which is a wireless subwoofer remote controller.

In order to create this project I've used the arduino UNO platform, a bluetooth module and some circuitry for the hardware part. For controllign the mentioned hardware I've created an Android application using MIT App Inventor which is an open source environment designed for creating Andorid Apps.
