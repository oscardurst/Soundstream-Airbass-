# Soundstream-Airbass-
Car audio old school is becoming popular nowadays, that is why I've decided to recreate an accessory which was popular back in the day, but now is hard to find. I am talking about the Soundstream Airbass which is a wireless subwoofer remote controller.

This accesory was compatible with a few Soundstream amplifiers with the ability to receive the Soundstream Airbass hardware, some of the models are: Soundstream Reference 500s, Reference 700s and Reference 1000s among others.

In order to create this project I've used the arduino UNO platform, a bluetooth module and some circuitry for the hardware part. For controlling the mentioned hardware I've created an Android application using MIT App Inventor which is an open source environment designed for developing Andorid Apps.
